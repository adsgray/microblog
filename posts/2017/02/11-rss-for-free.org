* RSS for free!                                                    :rss:blog:
  I was going to write some kind of software (ugh) to generate an RSS
  feed for posts to this blog but then I discovered that out of the
  box, [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7353538/setting-up-an-github-commit-rss-feed][github provides Atom feeds of the commits to your repository]].

  So [[https://github.com/adsgray/microblog/commits/master.atom][here]] is the feed for this blog.

  Of course it will include edits/corrections which IMO is a plus.
