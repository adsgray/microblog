* Read It Later                                                       :emacs:

** Very low-tech method

- I use [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][elfeed]] to read a bunch of RSS feeds
- If I find a link I want to read later I press 'y' to copy the URL
- Then 'C-x b' and switch to an eshell buffer
- Then run [[https://github.com/adsgray/scripts/blob/master/bash/fetcharticle.sh][fetcharticle.sh]] to get the contents of the page
- Later, run [[https://github.com/adsgray/scripts/blob/master/bash/ziparticles.sh][ziparticles.sh]] to create a ZIP archive of today's pages
- E-mail that zip file to myself
- Article ZIP archives live [[https://github.com/adsgray/articles][here]]
- I think it's hilarious and it reminds me of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWK_(file_format)][QWK]]
