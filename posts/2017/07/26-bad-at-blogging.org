* I'm bad at blogging

Probably the most important thing to do if you have a blog is to write
things and post them. That's the part I'm bad at. Here is a partial list of
things I would blog about if I was good at blogging:

- running
- making pickles
- baking bread
- hammocks (oh man I would blog so much about hammocks)
- cast iron pans
- emacs
- curling
- urban bicycle riding
- growing my hair long
