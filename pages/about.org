** Founded in 2017
** Obviates [[https://adsgray.github.io][my github.io blog]] where I never posted anyway
** Bonus Features
   - Use your browser's native "Back" and "Forward" buttons to
     navigate.
   - Never again will I have to look up how to format links in Markdown.
   - Yes there is an [[https://github.com/adsgray/microblog/commits/master.atom][RSS feed]]! To view the post follow the feed link,
     then click the "View" button. People who like the obscure
     "discoverable" interface of Snapchat should enjoy this.
